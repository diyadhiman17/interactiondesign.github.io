        <p class="description">
            sometimes, you’ve got to create your own closure. 
            life throws a lot at you—breakups, missed chances, and those pesky unfinished chapters.
             it can be super frustrating waiting for the perfect ending, 
             but that can just keep you stuck. instead, take the reins and find a way to 
             move on that feels right for you. think about what you’ve learned, embrace those lessons, 
             and let go of what’s holding you back. closure doesn’t always come from outside; often, 
             it comes from within. so trust yourself to write your own ending and dive into whatever comes next with confidence!
