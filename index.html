        joy, fear, worry, quiet, shame, brave, tired, free, longing, lonely, yearning, 
        missing, soft, doubt, heart, regret, healing, breaking, bloom, wilt, begin, end,

       Some things will feel too big at first. Mornings might arrive heavy and slow, 
       like they’re still deciding whether to stay. Time will stretch and collapse in strange ways, 
       weeks dissolving into minutes, and a single hour holding the weight of an entire season.
      </h2>
   

    
      <h3 class="h3-section">
        There will be versions of you that vanish quietly, without any final goodbye. 
        You won’t even notice them leaving until a familiar reaction feels foreign, 
        or a favorite song plays and doesn’t sting the same way. <br><br>
        It’s not loss. It’s just shift.<br><br>

        You will crave softness in louder and louder ways. The way light pools on the kitchen floor.
         A full glass of water. Clean socks. The voicemail you never delete. 
         The messy archive of feelings you promised to sort through “when you had time.” 
         <br> <br>
         The things that save you will not always look heroic.
        
        
      </h3>
    

    
   
      <h4 class="h4-section">
        It’s okay to forget who you thought you’d be. 
        That vision was built from guesses and borrowed voices.
         You will revise yourself many times. Some dreams will expire in your hands. 
         Others will surprise you by still being alive, tucked in the corner of a notebook or an old to-do list.
      </h4>
   

   
    
      <h5 class="h5-section">
        There’s a certain kind of magic in surviving what once felt unbearable. 
        You won’t always notice it right away. Some triumphs will feel like silence.
        Some peace will feel like boredom.
      </h5>
    

   
      <h6 class="h6-section">
        On certain days, nostalgia will feel like a second language. 
        You’ll be fluent in it without trying. Everything will remind you of something else: 
        the smell of summer rain, a line from a book you underlined too hard, 
        the song that played once while you were in love with someone who never looked at you quite right.
