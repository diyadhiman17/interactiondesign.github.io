        <p class="description">
            it’s a hard pill to swallow, but your parents had lives, dreams, and mistakes long before you showed up. 
            they’re not just your mom and dad; they were once young, full of hopes and dreams, 
            navigating their own struggles and failures. realizing this can completely shift how you 
            view your relationship with them. it helps you see them as individuals with their own stories 
            instead of just authority figures. understanding their pasts allows for deeper conversations and empathy. 
            it can lead to more meaningful connections, where you both appreciate each other’s journeys and realize you’re 
            all just trying to figure it out.
