        <p class="description">
          staying where you grew up offers comfort and familiarity, 
          a sense of safety that’s hard to leave behind. 
          but stepping out of that comfort zone and leaving home forces you 
          to grow in ways you can’t anticipate. you’ll discover strengths you 
          didn’t know you had, and face challenges that will shape who you become. 
          trust me, putting distance between yourself and the life you’ve always 
          known has a funny way of giving you perspective. 
          it allows you to see the world—and yourself—with fresh eyes, 
          unlocking new possibilities and growth that would have remained hidden 
          in the safety of the familiar.
