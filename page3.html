        hi! i'm diya. having reach the ripe ol' age of twenty three, i've gathered a treasure trove of valuable lessons- 
        mostly from recent disasters. 
        now naturally, i feel obligated to document all this wisdom i've stumbled upon.(and promptly forgotten) 
        theres just so much to impart, which is why i must document these fleeting moments of enlightenment before they disapper forever.
        so hopefully this website can help you go from a hot <strong>mess</strong> to a <strong>hot</strong> mess.
        </p>
