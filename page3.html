                    <h2>hi, i’m Diya! </h2>
                    <h3> I’m a graphic designer and illustrator, and honestly, I can’t imagine doing anything else. 
                        Creating visuals that tell stories, spark curiosity, or make people feel something? 
                        That’s what I live for. 
                        Whether I’m designing posters, whipping up a comic, or piecing together a zine, I find so much joy in bringing ideas to life. 
                       
                        If there’s one thing I’ve learned along the way, it’s that versatility is everything. 
                        Over the years, I’ve worked on so many different projects, and it’s pushed me to grow in ways I never expected. 
                        One day, I’ll be designing something sleek and minimalist, and the next, I’m drawing quirky characters or crafting layouts bursting with color and personality.
                         This mix keeps things interesting, and it’s probably why I’ll never get tired of what I do.

                    <h4> having reached the ripe ol' age of twenty-three,i've gathered a treasure trove of valuable 
                        life lessons- mostly from recent disasters. naturally, i feel the need to document all this 
                    wisdom i've stumbled upon(and promptly forgotten).
                
                    Of course, not everything in my creative journey has been smooth sailing. There have been plenty of moments where self-doubt has crept in, making me question if I’m good enough or if my ideas are even worth sharing. But I’ve realized that those moments are just part of the process. They remind me to keep learning, experimenting, and pushing myself to grow. After all, creativity isn’t about being perfect—it’s about being curious, fearless, and open to possibilities.</h4>
                    <h5>there is just so much i want to say,which i why is simply must put everything down,
                        before these fleeting moments of enlightenment disappear forever.
