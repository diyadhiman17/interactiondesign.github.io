        <h3>the importance of female friendships</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>having a strong circle of female friends is like holding onto a life raft in a sea of chaos. these are the relationships that will remind you who you are, even when you forget.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>staying where you grew up feels safe, but leaving forces you to grow in ways you never imagined. trust me, distance has a funny way of giving you perspective.</p>
