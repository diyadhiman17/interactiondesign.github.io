        <p class="description">
            turns out, “no” is a complete sentence. 
            you don’t owe anyone an explanation, and saying yes to everything is the quickest way to burnout. 
            it’s okay to set boundaries and protect your time, energy, and well-being. 
            learn the power of a polite (or not so polite) refusal, and don’t feel guilty about it. 
            prioritize what matters most to you, and let go of the pressure to please everyone. 
            saying “no” doesn’t make you selfish—it makes you wise. 
            by choosing when and where to invest your energy, you’ll have more space for the things that truly matter.
